# Information Leak Prevention Plan

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Identified ⚠️

### 1. **IMMEDIATE THREATS FIXED**
- ✅ User IDs being logged in plaintext in authentication flows
- ✅ Email addresses exposed in console logs
- ✅ Session tokens potentially exposed in debug logs

### 2. **COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED**

#### A. Automatic Data Masking
- **User IDs**: Only first 8 characters shown, rest masked as `***`
- **Email addresses**: Format `us***@domain.com`
- **Tokens/API Keys**: Completely masked as `***TOKEN***`
- **Passwords**: Never logged, automatically filtered

#### B. Production Console Blocking
- All console logs automatically blocked in production
- Development logs sanitized for sensitive data
- Emergency console restore available via `window.__restoreConsole()`

#### C. Multi-Layer Protection
1. **Source-level masking** in authentication hooks
2. **Global console wrapper** that sanitizes all outputs
3. **API response sanitization** middleware
4. **Security violation reporting** system

## 3. **STRICT PREVENTION RULES**

### Development Team Guidelines:
1. **NEVER log raw user data** - always use `safeLog` utility
2. **NEVER log authentication tokens** in any environment
3. **ALWAYS sanitize before logging** objects containing user data
4. **USE security audit functions** for any sensitive operations

### Code Review Checklist:
- [ ] No direct `console.log` with user data
- [ ] All sensitive data uses masking utilities
- [ ] Authentication flows use sanitized logging
- [ ] API responses are sanitized before logging
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or tokens

## 4. **MONITORING & DETECTION**

### Automatic Security Audit:
- Monitors all console outputs for sensitive patterns
- Reports violations in development mode
- Blocks sensitive data leaks in production
- Provides detailed leak reports with sanitized previews

### Violation Reporting:
```typescript
// Example of security violation detection
securityAudit.reportDataLeak('component_name', potentialLeakedData);
```

## 5. **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### Safe Logging Usage:
```typescript
// ❌ NEVER DO THIS
console.log('User logged in:', { userId: user.id, email: user.email });

// ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS
safeLog.info('User logged in', { userId: user.id, email: user.email });
```

### Sensitive Data Patterns Blocked:
- Email addresses: `user@domain.com` → `us***@domain.com`
- UUIDs: `bcb3dcea-917b-42e5-93c5-1578c7f91faa` → `bcb3dcea***`
- Tokens: `sk_live_abc123xyz` → `***TOKEN***`
- API Keys: `pk_test_abc123` → `***KEY***`

## 6. **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### If Data Leak Detected:
1. **Immediate**: Check production logs for sensitive data exposure
2. **Short-term**: Rotate any potentially exposed credentials
3. **Long-term**: Review and strengthen security measures

### Debug Mode Access:
```javascript
// In production, if debugging is absolutely necessary:
window.__restoreConsole(); // Restores original console functionality
```

## 7. **COMPLIANCE & BEST PRACTICES**

### Data Protection:
- GDPR compliance through data minimization
- No PII stored in logs or browser console
- Automatic sanitization of all user-related data

### Security Standards:
- Zero sensitive data exposure in production
- Comprehensive input sanitization
- Automated security violation detection
- Multi-layer defense strategy

## 8. **TESTING & VALIDATION**

### Security Tests Required:
1. Verify console blocking in production builds
2. Test data masking for all sensitive patterns
3. Validate security audit violation detection
4. Check API response sanitization

### Regular Audits:
- Weekly review of console logs for sensitive data
- Monthly security pattern updates
- Quarterly penetration testing of logging systems

## 9. **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

### Planned Improvements:
- Integration with external security monitoring
- Enhanced pattern detection for new data types
- Automated security report generation
- Real-time leak detection and alerting
